# SnowGum
Snow Gum is an Unreal 5 sample project built by Rhys (Luna) Vincent.
This game demo is a learning project where many techniques were implemented using C++.

The aim for Snow Gum is to demonstrate my skills as a Unreal engine developer and to show I can bring my unity engine skills over to unreal.

# Screenshots and Videos
None yet.

As the project grows, I will be adding videos here for each major mechanic in the project.

# Mechanics
TODO:
- Create movement mechanics
- Create saving and loading system
- Create some kind of procedural mesh generation system
- Create snow effect (I did name this project snow gum after all)
